# oven-controller

(Python & MATLAB version) In find constants I created a model of the oven behavior based on Newton's cooling equation and data measured while the oven was on.

(Only MATLAB version) In controller we simulate a PI controller and tune the gains until we can control the oven based off pulse-width modulation.
